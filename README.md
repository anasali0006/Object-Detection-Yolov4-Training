# Weapon Detection using YOLO v4. 
This repository contains the code for the training of Yolov4 Model for the detection of weapons.

Special thanks to [Quang Neguyeng's Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov4-in-google-colab-train-your-custom-dataset-traffic-signs-with-ease-3243ca91c81d). Steps given in that article are followed here and its Google Colab Notebook has also been used. I have modified the Google Colab Notebook for the training of Weapons/Pistols specifically.
