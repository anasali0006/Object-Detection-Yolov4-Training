Special thanks to [Quang Neguyeng's Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov4-in-google-colab-train-your-custom-dataset-traffic-signs-with-ease-3243ca91c81d). Steps given in that article are followed here and its Google Colab Notebook has also been used. I have modified the Google Colab Notebook for the training of Weapons/Pistols specifically and created a new Google Colab Notebook which is more user friendly and easy to use.
