# Weapon Detection using YOLO v4. 
This project is done to train a YOLOv4 model for the detection of handguns. The aim of the project is to develop state-of-the-art automatic weapon detection system which can be deployed using the cameras and embedded device like Jetson Nano. This will be a step forward towards 'Smart Cities' where crime will be reported to the Law Enforcements effectively without any time delay.

Special thanks to [Quang Neguyeng's Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov4-in-google-colab-train-your-custom-dataset-traffic-signs-with-ease-3243ca91c81d). Steps given in that article are followed here and its Google Colab Notebook has also been used. I have modified the Google Colab Notebook for the training of Weapons/Pistols specifically and created a new Google Colab Notebook which is more user friendly and easy to use. 

The dataset which is used for the training of the Weapons Detection Model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15L4KCo61a34GdWZLCk-du-JFx-KHCTBz/view?usp=sharing). A lot of effort has been put to collect and annotate good quality data from various internet sources. There are total of 5,648 images of pistols inhere. We have tried to include pistols from as much scenarios as possible. A small glimpse of the dataset is given.
